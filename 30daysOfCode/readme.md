## Claude 3.7 Sunnet Eplanation

I'll explain how to solve this problem clearly in English, without providing any code, just instructions for you to implement in Python 3.
Understanding the problem:  
You need to separate characters from a string based on their indices: characters at even positions (0, 2, 4...) and characters at odd positions (1, 3, 5...).
### Step-by-step instructions:

Read the number of test cases T from the first line.
For each of the T test cases:

---
Read a string S.
Create two empty strings: one to store characters at even indices and another for odd indices.
Iterate through each character of string S using its index.
If the index is even (0, 2, 4...), add the character to the even-indexed string.
If the index is odd (1, 3, 5...), add the character to the odd-indexed string.
Print the even-indexed string, followed by a space, followed by the odd-indexed string.

---
Specific tips:

Remember that in Python, indices start at 0, and 0 is considered even in this problem.
You can use a for loop with the range() function to iterate through the string indices.
To check if a number is even, use the modulo operator (%) - if i % 2 == 0, then i is even.
To concatenate characters to strings, you can use the += operator or create lists and join them at the end.

Logic example:

---
If S = "Hacker", the even-indexed characters are "Hce" (H=0, c=2, e=4)
The odd-indexed characters are "akr" (a=1, k=3, r=5)
The output would be "Hce akr"

This should be sufficient for you to implement the program in Python 3 without needing specific code.
